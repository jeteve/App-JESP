=head1 NAME

App::JESP - Just Enough SQL Patches

=cut

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Use the command line utility:

  jesp

Or use from your own program (in Perl):

  my $jesp = App::JESP->new({ home => 'path/to/jesphome',
                              dsn => ...,
                              username => ...,
                              password => ...
                            });

  $jsep->install();
  $jesp->deploy();

=cut

=head1 CONFIGURATION

All JESP configuration must live in a JESP home directory.

This home directory must contain a plan.json file, containing the patching
plan for your DB. See plan.json section below for the format of this file.

=head2 plan.json

This file MUST live in your JESP home directory. It has to contain
a json datastructure like this:

  {
    "patches": [
        { "id":"foobartable", "sql": "CREATE TABLE foobar(id INT PRIMARY KEY)"},
        { "id":"foobar_more", "file": "patches/morefoobar.sql" }
        { "id":"foobar_abs",  "file": "/absolute/path/to/patches/evenmore.sql" },
        { "id":"a_backfill_script", "file": "path/to/executable/file.sh" }
    ]
  }

Patches MUST have a unique ID in all the plan, and they can either
contain raw SQL (SQL key), or point to a file of your choice (in the JESP home)
itself containing the SQL.

You are encouraged to look in L<https://github.com/jeteve/App-JESP/tree/master/t> for examples.

=head1 PATCH TYPES

=head1 sql

Simply add the SQL statement to execute in your patch structure:

  {
    "patches": [
        ...
        { "id":"foobartable", "sql": "CREATE TABLE foobar(id INT PRIMARY KEY)"}
        ...
  }

This is convenient for very short SQL statment.

=head1 sql files

Point to a file that contains SQL statement(s) to be executed. The filename can be either absolute
or relative to the directory that contains the plan.

  {
    "patches": [
         ...
        { "id":"foobar_more", "file": "patches/morefoobar.sql" }
        { "id":"foobar_abs",  "file": "/absolute/path/to/patches/evenmore.sql" },
         ...
    ]
  }

The directory structure is free, but of course you are encouraged to keep it clean.

=head1 script files (Unix only)

Point to an EXECUTABLE file. (absolute or relative to the plan directory):

  {
    "patches": [
        ...
        { "id":"a_backfill_script", "file": "path/to/executable/file.sh" }
        ...
    ]
  }

See L<APP::JESP::Driver#apply_script> to see what environment the script is ran in. Note that the script
needs to be executable by the current user to be detected as a script.

=head1 COMPATIBILITY

Compatibility of the meta-schema with SQLite, MySQL and PostgreSQL is guaranteed through automated testing.
To see which versions are actually tested, look at the CI build:
L<https://travis-ci.org/jeteve/App-JESP/>

=head1 DRIVERS

This comes with the following built-in drivers:

=head2 SQLite

Just in case. Note that your patches will be executed in the same connection
this uses to manage the metadata.

=head2 mysql

This will use the `mysql` executable on the disk (will look for it in PATH)
to execute your patches, exactly like you would do on the command line.

=head2 Pg

This will use a new connection to the Database to execute the patches.
This is to allow you using BEGIN ; COMMIT; to make your patch transactional
without colliding with the Meta data management transaction.

=head2 Your own driver.

Should you want to write your own driver, simply extend L<App::JESP::Driver>
and implement any method you like (most likely you will want apply_sql).

To use your driver, simply give its class to the constuctor:

  my $jesp = App::JESP->new({ .., driver_class => 'My::App::JESP::Driver::SpecialDB' });

Or if you prefer to build an instance yourself:

  my $jesp;
  $jesp = App::JESP->new({ .., driver => My::App::JESP::Driver::SpecialDB->new({ jesp => $jesp,  ... ) });

=head1 MOTIVATIONS & DESIGN

Over the years as a developer, I have used at least three ways of managing SQL patches.
The ad-hoc way with a hand-rolled system which is painful to re-implement,
the L<DBIx::Class::Migration> way which I didn't like at all, and more recently
L<App::Sqitch> which I sort of like.

All these systems somehow just manage to do the job, but unless they are very complicated (there
are no limits to hand-rolled complications..) they all fail to provide a sensible
way for a team of developers to work on database schema changes at the same time.

So I decided the world needs yet another SQL patch management system that
does what my team and I really really want.

Here are some design principles this package is attempting to implement:

=over

=item Write your own SQL

No funny SQL generated from code here. By nature, any ORM will always lag behind its
target DBs' features. This means that counting on software to generate SQL statement from
your ORM classes will always prevent you from truly using the full power of your DB of choice.

With App::JESP, you have to write your own SQL for your DB, and this is a good thing.

=item No version numbers

App::JESP simply keeps track of which ones of your named patches are applied to the DB.
Your DB version is just that: The subset of patches that were applied to it. This participates
in allowing several developers to work on different parts of the DB in parallel.

=item No fuss patch ordering

The order in which patches are applied is important. But it is not important
to the point of enforcing exactly the same order on every DB the patches are deployed to.
App::JESP applies the named patches in the order it finds them in the plan, only taking
into account the ones that have not been applied yet. This allows developer to work
on their development DB and easily merge patches from other developers.

=item JSON Based

This is the 21st century, and I feel like I shouldn't invent my own file format.
This uses JSON like everything else.

=item Simple but complex things allowed.

You will find no complex feature in App::JESP, and we pledge to keep the meta schema
simple, to allow for easy repairs if things go wrong.

=item Programmable

It's great to have a convenient command line tool to work and deploy patches, but maybe
your development process, or your code layout is a bit different. If you use L<App::JESP>
from Perl, it should be easy to embed and run it yourself.

=item What about reverting?

Your live DB is not the place to test your changes. Your DB at <My Software> Version N should
be compatible with Code at <My Software> Version N-1. You are responsible for testing that.

We'll probably implement reverting in the future, but for now we assume you
know what you're doing when you patch your DB.

=back

=head1 METHODS

=head2 install

Installs or upgrades the JESP meta tables in the database. This is idem potent.
Note that the JESP meta table(s) will be all prefixed by B<$this->prefix()>.

Returns true on success. Will die on error.

Usage:

  $this->install();

=head2 status

Returns the list of L<App::JESP::Patch> with their application Datetime if this is known.
This will ALSO return the orphans (patches that are recorded as applied but not in the plan).

Usage:

  my $status = $this->status();

  $status is like:
     {
        plan_patches => [ list of App::JESP::Patch ],
        plan_orphans => [ list of orphan patch IDs ]
     };

=head2 deploy

Deploys the unapplied patches from the plan in the database and record
the new DB state in the meta schema. Dies if the meta schema is not installed (see install method).

Returns the number of patches applied.

Usage:

  print "Applied ".$this->deploy()." patches";

Options:

=over

=item patches [ 'patch_one' , 'patch_two' ]

Specify the patches to apply. This is useful in combination with C<force>
(to force a data producing patch to run for instance), or with C<logonly>.

=item force 1|0

Force patches applications, regardless of the fact they have been applied already or not.
Note that it does not mean it's ok for the patches to fail. Any failing patch will still
terminates the deploy method. This is particularly useful in combination with the 'patches'
option where you can choose which patch to apply. Defaults to 0.

=item logonly 1|0

Only record the application of patches in the metadata, without effectively applying them.
